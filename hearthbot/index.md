A Hearthstone playing robot that reads game logs to determine current
plays by opponent, and UI automation to control the mouse and play the
game via UI interaction.

Employs simple statistical models of game situations for determining
playing strategy, & a behavior fuzzing mechanism for avoiding bot
detection.

Never used in an unlawful manner, just for fun.
