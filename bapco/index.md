Part of the "Action Learning Program 2008." The Action Learning
Program is a two months program that involves teaming up Crown Prince
International Scholarship Program students with delegates of major
companies in Bahrain to work on a real challenge.

The Action Learning team balances between improving the behaviour and
skills of its team members and at the same time aims at producing a
result. This program began with a month long induction period that
builds leadership, management, and networking skills, and ends with
the pairing up of team groups with Bahraini companies.

The Challenge for our team: “Identify and Evaluate Carbon Credit
Opportunities to Improve the Environmental Impact of the Bahrain
Petroleum Company”

After two months of research and work, this culminated in a proposal
and report.
