Botnet Atom Realtime Detector, an active distributed firewall whose
primary purpose is to detect and protect against botnet attacks and
infiltration. This is done by analyzing network flow information for
patterns common to botnet behaviors and attacks, and uses a particular
packet trait known as 'persistence'. This was a group-based project,
and you can find lots more details in the design document.
