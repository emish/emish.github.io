## Biologically Motivated Speech Recognition

Speech perception is uniquely human, so applying theories about human
psycholinguistic systems to computer speech recognition may improve
performance. In the natural model, computations are performed by
brains using data from ears. Thus, perhaps effective speech
recognition can be performed by a brain-like machine learning
algorithm receiving ear-like inputs. It is theorized that human
listeners translate speech sounds into the lip and tongue movements
that produced them - perhaps a speech recognizer that could relate
sound to articulation would perform well. This project aims to employ
Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM), a brain-like algorithm, in
identifying ear-transformed audio with the help of X-ray articulation
data. An experimental architecture was developed, but reliable HTM
results were not obtained.
